CIS 251 Final Project Instructions
Fall 2020

The final project is to write SQL to enhance the JLDB database. The project includes writing SQL as well as using PL/SQL.
1.	Create an audit table which will be populated each time a books retail price or cost is changed. The name, what fields you include in the audit table and itâ€™s intended use are for you to determine.

DROP TABLE books_audit_table CASCADE CONSTRAINTS;
DROP TRIGGER books_update_trig;

CREATE TABLE books_audit_table
(
  ISBN VARCHAR2(10),
  title VARCHAR2(30),
  retail NUMBER(5, 2),
  cost NUMBER(5, 2),
  description VARCHAR2(20)
);

2.	Create a trigger to populate the audit table described above

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER books_update_trig 
BEFORE
UPDATE OF retail, cost ON books
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  IF UPDATING ('retail') THEN
    INSERT INTO books_audit_table(ISBN, title, retail, cost, description) VALUES(:OLD.ISBN, :OLD.title, :NEW.retail, :NEW.cost, 'Retail value changed');
  ELSIF UPDATING ('cost') THEN
    INSERT INTO books_audit_table(ISBN, title, retail, cost, description) VALUES(:OLD.ISBN, :OLD.title, :NEW.retail, :NEW.cost, 'Cost value changed');
  END IF;
END;
/

3.	Create a function which returns the average retail price of all books in the books table

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION avg_price
RETURN NUMBER
IS
  AP NUMBER := 0;
BEGIN
  SELECT AVG(retail) INTO AP FROM books;
  RETURN AP;
END AVG_PRICE;
/

4.	Create a procedure which utilizes a cursor to update the retail price of all books in the books by a given percentage
Each problem is worth 25% of the final project grade.

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE update_audit_table()
IS

BEGIN

END;

--Sample Data

SELECT * FROM books_audit_table;
UPDATE books SET retail = ;
UPDATE books SET  cost = ;
SELECT * FROM books_audit_table;
